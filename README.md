# experiment
test dataset for advances in the application of deep learning in protein-protein interaction prediction

Due to the large size of the raw data from H. sapiens and Sa. cerevisiae species, it exceeds the website's upload limit. Even after compressing the data, we are unable to upload it. 
Therefore, we provide the official download link for the raw data, which can be accessed on the official website for individual download.

# H. sapiens

# Sa. cerevisiae
address: https://string-db.org/cgi/download?sessionId=bw6HbmIqSIna&species_text=Saccharomyces+cerevisiae
interaction data: 4932.protein.links.v11.5.txt
